# Conventions — pdomain-prep-for-pgdp

<!-- workspace-conventions:start -->

## Rule: No comments explaining what code does

**The rule.** Don't add comments that restate what the code does;
well-named identifiers already do that. Only add a comment when the
WHY is non-obvious: a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, or a
workaround for a specific bug.

**Why.** Comments rot when code changes and become misleading. The rule
also applies to docstrings — one short line max; no multi-paragraph
docstrings and no multi-line comment blocks.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- One-line summary comment immediately above a function that restates its name.
- `# returns the X` or `# sets the Y` before a return/assignment statement.
- Multi-line docstrings that explain every parameter with no non-obvious WHY.
- Section divider blocks: `# ---…---` / `# ===…===` multi-line banners used as
  navigation headers in test files — class names and blank lines already
  provide structure; remove the banner, keep the blank lines.
- Multi-paragraph module or class docstrings with a "Focus on:" / "Covers:"
  section — collapse to a single-line summary.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- Comments that reference the PR, issue, or task that introduced the code — belongs in commit message, not source.
- Multi-line preamble that mixes WHY (worth keeping) with WHAT (worth removing).

## Rule: Unicode escape sequences for ruff-flagged ambiguous characters

**The rule.** Characters ruff flags under RUF001/002/003 (ambiguous Unicode —
curly quotes, en-dashes, em-dashes, multiplication signs, non-breaking spaces,
etc.) must be written as `\uXXXX` escape sequences in string and docstring
literals. In comments, replace with the plain ASCII equivalent. In every case
include a short inline comment naming the character, e.g.
`"""  # LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK`.

**Why.** Literal curly quotes and dashes are visually indistinguishable from
ASCII equivalents in most editors and diff views, making string comparisons and
grep silently fragile. Escape sequences make intent explicit and are safe across
all encodings. `# noqa: RUF00x` masks the problem instead of fixing it.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- A string literal containing `"hello – world"` written with the literal
  `–` character instead of the escape sequence.
- `# noqa: RUF001`, `# noqa: RUF002`, or `# noqa: RUF003` suppressions instead
  of escape sequences.
- `RUF002` or `RUF003` added to `[tool.ruff.lint] ignore` in `pyproject.toml`
  to paper over ambiguous characters.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- Test strings that intentionally exercise curly-quote round-trip through the
  OCR pipeline and must contain the literal character — keep the literal with an
  explicit `# noqa: RUF001  # intentional: testing curly-quote round-trip`
  comment that names the character and states the reason.

## Rule: Use `uv run` for all Python and tool invocation

**The rule.** Invoke Python, pytest, ruff, mypy/pyright, and any project-local
CLI through `uv run`. Never call bare `python`, `python3`, `pytest`, or
`pre-commit` from a Makefile target, CI step, or hook.

**Why.** Direct invocation skips the project's `.venv` and the lockfile-pinned
toolchain; tests pass locally and fail in CI (or vice versa) because the bare
interpreter sees different installed package versions. `uv run` is uniformly
fast (<200 ms warm) and always selects the project venv.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- `python -m pytest` or `python3 script.py` in any `Makefile`, `*.sh`,
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`, or `.pre-commit-config.yaml` hook.
- `pre-commit run` (bare) instead of `uv run pre-commit run` in CI or scripts.
- `ruff check` or `pyright` (bare) in scripts that don't activate a venv first.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- One-off REPL commands typed in CT's interactive shell — out of scope for this rule.

## Rule: Design spec files live in `docs/specs/` until the milestone ships

**The rule.** A design spec file produced by `/spec-from-issue` lives at
`docs/specs/<date>-<topic>-design.md` while the milestone's chore issues are open.
When the milestone's last chore closes and the implementation lands, move the file to
`docs/architecture/` in a housekeeping commit:

```bash
git mv docs/specs/<date>-<topic>-design.md docs/architecture/
git commit -m "docs: promote <topic> spec to architecture/ (milestone shipped)"
```

Update any `Spec: docs/specs/...` pointers in still-open issues after the move.

**Why.** `docs/specs/` is the active working area — implementing agents follow `Spec:`
pointers to find their instructions. `docs/architecture/` is the permanent design record
for shipped features. Mixing shipped and in-progress specs in one directory makes it
unclear which specs are still authoritative for ongoing work.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- A spec file remaining in `docs/specs/` after its milestone's last chore issue closes.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- A milestone with one chore still open but all substantive work done — CT decides
  whether to move the spec early or wait for the final chore to close.

## Rule: Document every lint-rule suppression

**The rule.** Prefer fixing the underlying issue; suppress a lint rule only
when the deviation is genuinely correct (e.g. an optional dependency import
guarded by `try`/`except`). When a suppression *is* warranted —
`# pyright: ignore[...]`, `# type: ignore[...]`, `# noqa: ...`, or a
`[tool.ruff.lint]` `ignore` / `per-file-ignores` entry — it must (1) carry a
short inline rationale at the point of deviation explaining *why* the
suppression is safe, and (2) be catalogued in the repo's
`docs/process/lint-deviations.md`, which records the rule, the tool, the
file locations, and the justification. Use basedpyright's native
`# pyright: ignore[reportRuleName]` form — mypy-style `# type: ignore[code]`
codes are not honored by basedpyright.

**Why.** A bare suppression hides whether the deviation was a deliberate,
reviewed decision or a shortcut, and rots silently when the surrounding code
changes. The inline comment makes intent visible where the code is read; the
central doc makes the whole suppression set auditable in one place so it can't
quietly grow. This rule is the escape valve for the
"Unicode escape sequences" rule above — when a `# noqa` genuinely must stay,
this is how it gets justified.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- A `# pyright: ignore`, `# type: ignore`, or `# noqa` with no adjacent comment
  stating why the suppression is safe.
- mypy-style `# type: ignore[import-not-found]` used to suppress a basedpyright
  diagnostic — replace with `# pyright: ignore[reportMissingImports]`.
- A bare unscoped `# type: ignore` / `# noqa` with no bracketed rule code.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- A suppression whose inline rationale exists but is missing from
  `docs/process/lint-deviations.md` — CT decides whether to catalogue it or
  remove the suppression.
- A long-standing suppression whose stated rationale no longer holds after a
  refactor — CT decides whether to drop the suppression.

## Rule: basedpyright — fix the warning, don't suppress it

**The rule.** The workspace runs basedpyright with `failOnWarnings = true`
in every repo. Zero warnings tolerated on `main`. When basedpyright flags a
warning, prefer a real fix — explicit type annotation, narrowing, `cast`
where genuinely needed — over a `# pyright: ignore[...]`. Only suppress
when the underlying gap is upstream (genuinely-untyped third-party library,
soft-optional dep not in the lockfile) AND no `py.typed` wheel exists. In
that case, follow "Document every lint-rule suppression" above.

**Why.** Three concrete patterns recur and each is fixable, not
ignorable:

1. `reportMissingTypeStubs` on a `pd_*` sibling import — pdomain-book-tools
   v0.14.0+ and pdomain-ops v0.3.0+ ship `py.typed`. Bump the wheel pin in
   `pyproject.toml` instead of adding an ignore. Note: `py.typed` only
   guarantees a top-level marker; attribute-level typing may still surface
   as `Any` in some access patterns (especially `getattr()` chains —
   `getattr()` always returns `Any` regardless of upstream typing).
   Prefer direct attribute access (`obj.attr`) over `getattr(obj, "attr")`.
2. `reportAny` on a value pulled from a `dict[str, Any]` or an untyped
   third-party return — narrow with an explicit `cast(T, …)` or annotate
   the unpacking target. Don't suppress.
3. `reportUnnecessaryCast` — a redundant `cast(T, x)` or `T(x)` where `x`
   is already `T`. Delete the cast; don't ignore the warning.

When a suppression *is* warranted, the placement matters: basedpyright
attributes a diagnostic to a specific line. For a multi-line
`from foo import (\n    bar,\n)` the diagnostic attaches to the
`from foo import (` line, not the symbol line. A `# pyright: ignore` on
the wrong line yields two warnings — the original (still unsuppressed)
plus `reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment` on the misplaced ignore. Run
`uv run basedpyright <pkg>` and read the column-prefixed output to find
the line basedpyright reports.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- `# pyright: ignore[reportMissingTypeStubs]` on a `pdomain_book_tools` or
  `pdomain_ops` import — the wheel ships `py.typed`; bump the pin and
  delete the ignore.
- `cast(X, y)` or `X(y)` (e.g. `str(y)`) immediately followed by code that
  treats `y` as already type `X` because the source is annotated `X` —
  redundant; remove.
- `# pyright: ignore[<rule>]` on a line basedpyright doesn't attribute
  the diagnostic to (verify with `uv run basedpyright` column output).
- Adding `--level error` or any other CI flag to suppress warnings
  globally — `failOnWarnings = true` is the workspace standard; fix the
  warning at the source.
- `getattr(obj, "attr")` where `obj` is annotated as a typed class with
  attribute `attr` — direct attribute access type-checks; `getattr()`
  drops the type to `Any`.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- A `cast(T, x)` where `x` is `Any` from an untyped third-party return —
  acceptable, but consider whether a shipped stubs package would be
  better long-term.
- A `# pyright: ignore[reportMissingImports]` on a genuinely-optional
  dep (e.g. cupy, torch under CPU-only CI) — acceptable when the import
  is also try/except-guarded; bot flags so CT can confirm the dep really
  is optional.
- A `# pyright: ignore[reportAny]` on a FastAPI `Depends(...)` default —
  acceptable; the framework's `Depends()` return type is intentionally
  `Any` so handlers can declare their own signatures.
